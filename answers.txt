What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge combines the changes of a source and a target branch, creating a new commit to do so. Because only the target branch is changed, the history of both branches is perserved fully. A rebase integrates all of the changes from a source branch into the target branch. This gets rid of the source branch, and therefore does not perserve all of its history.
